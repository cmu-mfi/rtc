# Robotics Training Center

...

*<insert license and collaboration medium>*

### Purpose
* To create robotic skills that can be combined with each other to enable a robot to perform a manufacturing task
* For manufacturing tasks, we focus on the following
    * MFI Lego block assembly
    * As many of the NIST assembly / disassembly tasks as possible
* To create an autonomy pipeline that can be transferred to the ARM Institute for generalization across the robots that they have, and for extension to other forms of manufacturing tasks, as appropriate
		
### Environment
There are two environments of reference in this project:
* [The CMU-MFI Testbed]()
* [The ARM RTC robot cell]()
