# Robotics Training Center

The center includes a set of robots repeatedly performing manufacturing and assembly manipulation tasks with an adjustable level of variation. The underlying software stack is modular such that individual software components can be easily switched with a data-driven model. To achieve the vision, the project consisted of five core thrusts:

1. Self-supervised vision-based object manipulation
2. Vibrotactile sensing for monitoring manufacturing processes
3. Integration and development of a digital backbone for large-scale data collection and processing in robotics training
4. Identification of technology adoption incentive mechanisms for manufacturing ecosystems
5. Development of strategies for the transition of the above technologies to the ARM Institute ecosystem

### Purpose
* To create robotic skills that can be combined with each other to enable a robot to perform a manufacturing task
* For manufacturing tasks, we focus on the following
    * MFI Lego block assembly
    * As many of the NIST assembly / disassembly tasks as possible
* To create an autonomy pipeline that can be transferred to the ARM Institute for generalization across the robots that they have, and for extension to other forms of manufacturing tasks, as appropriate
		
### Environment
There are two environments of reference in this project:
* [The CMU-MFI Testbed]()
* [The ARM RTC robot cell]()
