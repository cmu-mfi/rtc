The diagram below shows how various equipment, sensors and virtual machines are connected to one another. Few key points to note:

* The physical hardware of the cloud infrastructure is on CMU main campus
* Mezzanine Lab equipment is located at Mill19 campus of CMU
* The system is setup at one of the CMU labs [Mezzanine Lab](https://engineering.cmu.edu/mfi/facilities/equipment-details/mezzanine-lab.html). Multiple workstations and robots facilitate parallel research and engineering work on multiple "thrusts" of the project.

## Task Execution

A manufacturing task, like inserting a male connector to a female connector, is executed by using both vision and vibrotactile skills of the system. Below is a high-level flow diagram of how different skills are executed to fulfill a task to assemble a connector.
